# Light And Dark Theme

A webapp made using React to toggle the theme of the webapp from light mode to dark mode and vice-versa, on clicking of the toggle button.  
Link to live webapp: https://light-dark-theme-noob.netlify.app/
- This webapp has routes to 3 main pages:
  - "/" -> Home
  - "/about" -> About
  - "/blog" -> Blog
- Any other route will lead to Error Page
- The navbar will be visible on all pages
- On clicking of the toggle button, the entire theme of the webapp will change from light to dark and vice-versa
- The theme is stored in localStorage, so next time the webapp is opened in new tab, the previously set theme will reflect automatically
